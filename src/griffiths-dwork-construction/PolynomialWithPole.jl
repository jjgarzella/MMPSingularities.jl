module PolynomialWithPole

using Oscar

"""
A polynomial with (a) pole is mathematically
an element of k[x_1, ..., x_n]_f, the localization
of the polynomial right at an element f. 
For us, f is predetermined.

Such an element is determined by the order of the pole
and the numerator, i.e. a polynomial.

Right now, this is modeled in our code by 
arrays of length 2. 
The first term is an oscar polynomial and 
the second is an integer, the pole order.

Another common type is an array of polynomials
with pole, ordered by pole order. 

I suspect in the future we may change this to
an array of tuples or a custom struct. 
If/when that happens, hopefully all of the necessary 
changes will be in this file.

NOTE: these typealiases aren't used anywhere yet, 
it mostly exists so that this docstring can exist
right now.
