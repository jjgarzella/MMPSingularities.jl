# Computational linear algebra library.

A specialized computational linear algebra library designed for optimized and fast matrix multiplication, tailored for cohomology computations over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$. This library empowers researchers with efficient tools for solving systems over finite fields to enhance the computational capabilities in algebraic geometry studies.
