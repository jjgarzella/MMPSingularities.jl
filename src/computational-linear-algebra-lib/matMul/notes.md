## Meeting agenda

# Matrix Multiplication
Fix up implemtation
Use OSCAR, inherit from abstract type
Make it a drop in replacement

# Benchmarks
Afterwards prepare for benchmarks
First on random matrices
Test every library -> TODO see if we have access to supercomputers

Two different benchmarks for Julia
One is precompiled, one is without compilation i.e. call directly in script
